**** Real time exercise detection and Correction system using machine learning  ****

 **Description**

For this project, we created an artificial intelligence (AI) that interprets webcam footage, recognises exercises in real time, and counts reps.

A pretrained CNN is utilised for real-time pose estimation, your machine's webcam is accessed via OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras is utilised to create unique deep learning models that identify the type of exercise being performed.

To create training data for the unique deep learning models, this project also offers a guided data gathering pipeline.
